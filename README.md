**Deadlock Anti-Cheat** is a powerful anti-cheat system designed for seamless integration into game client and server environments. It protects against various cheats while ensuring smooth gameplay and secure networking.

## Features

- üîí **Dynamic Cheat Detection**: Monitors game processes to detect and prevent cheats in real-time.
- ‚ö° **Client-Server Synchronization**: Exchanges secure messages between the client and server to validate game logic and ensure integrity.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Engine Compatibility**: Supports integration with multiple game engines.
- üéÆ **Lightweight Design**: Minimal impact on game performance.
- üîç **API Integration**: Provides a robust API for developers to manage anti-cheat functions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (or newer) with C++ tools.
- Windows 10/11 SDK.
- Admin privileges for debugging and deployment.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deadlockhook/deadlock-anti-cheat.git
   cd deadlock-anti-cheat
   ```
2. Open `deadlock.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution in Release mode.
4. Integrate the generated `.dll` file into your game‚Äôs executable directory.
5. Include the provided `.lib` file in your game server project.
6. Use the client API to manage anti-cheat operations in your game.

## Usage

### Game Client

1. Load the `.dll` file in the game executable during initialization.
2. Use the provided API from the client API files to handle anti-cheat functionality.
3. Ensure the game‚Äôs networking manager is set up for communication with the game server.

### Game Server

1. Link the `.lib` file to your game server project.
2. The `.lib` file will handle the mini game server logic.
3. Configure secure communication between the game server and the client through the game‚Äôs networking manager.

## System Architecture

- **Client Module**:
  - A `.dll` file loaded into the game executable to monitor and handle cheats.
  - Provides an API for developers to integrate anti-cheat logic.
- **Server Module**:
  - A `.lib` file included in the game server.
  - Manages mini game server logic and secure communication with the client.
